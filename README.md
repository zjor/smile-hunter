# 😊 Smile Hunter

**Train your brain for positivity through play**

Smile Hunter is a web-based game inspired by Attention Bias Modification (ABM) research. The goal is simple: quickly find the smiling face among a grid of neutral or negative expressions. This deceptively simple exercise has been shown in scientific studies to help retrain how your brain processes social information.

## 🧠 The Science Behind It

People experiencing anxiety, depression, or stress often develop a "negativity bias" — their attention naturally gravitates toward threatening or negative stimuli (like frowning faces) rather than positive ones. This creates a self-reinforcing cycle where negative information gets amplified.

**Attention Bias Modification Training (ABMT)** uses the "visual search paradigm" to break this cycle. By repeatedly practicing finding positive stimuli (smiling faces) among negative ones, you can gradually retrain your automatic attention patterns.

### Key Research Findings

- **Reduced stress hormones**: A McGill University study found that telemarketers who played a similar "find the smile" game for 5-10 minutes daily had **17% lower cortisol levels** by the end of the week, reported less stress, and made more sales (Dandeneau et al., 2007)

- **Enhanced optimism**: A 2019 study showed that 2 weeks of daily training (80 trials/day) significantly **increased optimism bias** compared to control groups (Kress & Aue, 2019)

- **Reduced anxiety in children**: Visual search ABMT training led to significant reductions in clinician-rated anxiety severity in children (Waters et al., 2015, 2019)

- **Improved mood**: Meta-analyses confirm that ABM can help reduce depressive symptoms, particularly when negative attentional bias is successfully modified (Yang et al., 2016)

## 🎯 How It Works

1. A 3×3 grid of faces appears on screen
2. Find and tap the smiling face as quickly as possible
3. Complete rounds (5, 10, or 15) to build the mental habit
4. Repeat daily for best results — research suggests 3-5 minutes per day, at least 4 times per week

The magic happens through repetition: each time you disengage from neutral/negative faces to find the positive one, you're strengthening neural pathways that favor positivity.
